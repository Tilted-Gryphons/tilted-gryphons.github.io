# Recruit Information

Although we do not have a great many casual players, anyone is welcome to join the guild. Our requirements are simple: < br/>
• You need to be over 18. <br />
• Don't be crass, vile, or toxic. <br />
We want to create and maintain a friendly guild that everyone is proud to be a part of. Be conscious that you have our guild name above your head when you're out in the world. We want members who are as courteous to a random stranger as they are to their guildmates.

### Raiding
If you'd like to join as a raider, there are a great many more requirements. First and foremost, do we have an opening for your class? <br />
We may be interested in picking up exceptional players regardless of whether we are actively recruiting a class, so if you're really keen to join our guild specifically, feel free to try your luck!

• Meet any special requirements laid out by your [Class Lead](https://tilted-gryphons.github.io/guild-structure.html). <br />

### Recruitment Process
You will have posted in the #new-recruits Discord channel. We will see this post and the CL for your class will respond to you. If we want to recruit you, then you will need to complete an interview with the Class Lead and at least one other officer via voice chat. To avoid crowding and intimidation we prefer to keep this to a maximum of three officers.

We _will_ reach out to your previous guild and ask them about you. However we aren't scary, we're just trying to protect our guild and recruit people who share our attitude towards raiding and who seem like decent, kind people.
