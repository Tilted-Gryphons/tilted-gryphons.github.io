# Recruit Information

Although we do not have a great many casual players, anyone is welcome to join the guild. Our requirements are simple: < br/>
• You need to be over 18. <br />
• Don't be crass, vile, or toxic. <br />
We want to create and maintain a friendly guild that everyone is proud to be a part of. Be conscious that you have our guild name above your head when you're out in the world. We want members who are as courteous to a random stranger as they are to their guildmates.

### Raiding
If you'd like to join as a raider, there are a great many more requirements. First and foremost, do we have an opening for your class? <br />
We may be interested in picking up exceptional players regardless of whether we are actively recruiting a class, so if you're really keen to join our guild specifically, feel free to try your luck!
