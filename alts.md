# All about Alts

TLDR: If you are a core raider, you may post your alt application in the #alt-applications channel and wait for your main CL and your alt CL to both add any reaction icon other than a red X to approve your alt. Alts will only be given gear that would otherwise get DE’d. Your alt and main must be logged at the instance entrance, and you must be prepared to raid on either character.

- Core raider’s alts are allowed to come to raid content that is one release behind the most recent raid. 
- Alts may come to ZG, AQ20, and Ony regardless of content age, but you still need permission to bring your alt.
- A maximum of 6 alts may attend a raid.
- You must apply to bring your alt. Post in the #alt-applications channel to start the approval process. You must provide a wowhead link to your current gear and spec for your alt’s CL to review.
- First, your Main’s CL must sign off on your Main not needing anything from the raid that you want to bring your Alt to. (They will be reasonable with side-grades, etc). Your Main’s CL will apply a positive reaction on your alt application post.
- Then the class leader of your Alt must also sign off on your Alt’s gear and spec which should be somewhat appropriate for the raid in question; 50% pre-raid items is a rough guideline but your Alt’s class officer will have their own requirements. Jump through their hoops to get your second positive reaction on your alt application post.
- If either CL has an issue, they will react with a red X on your alt application post. Just one red X means you can’t bring your alt.
- You must actively play your Alt during a raid (duh!). If you are AFK or parsing in the grey your Alt probably won’t be invited back.
- We will not be summoning Mains/Alts to swap out on different fights. There are exceptions to this rule such as class items from Domo's chest.
- Everyone needs to apply to bring their alt.
- Your alt doesn't have to be in guild, but it is preferred.
