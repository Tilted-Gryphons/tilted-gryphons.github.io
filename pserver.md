# Pserver
**Please read the instructions through once before beginning!**
We have tested this old client and it has bugs! These instructions, if followed, will help you avoid most common issues entirely!

## Getting Started
* [Create an Account](http://54.172.9.103/)
* Download the client for your PC
  * [Windows Client](https://bit.ly/2yrD0VR)
  * [Mac Client](https://bit.ly/2WYm5na)
*The relmlist is already set in these clients but if you already have a client set your realmlist to: 54.172.9.103*

## First Steps
* Create an account.
* Unzip folder anywhere you want, just remember where it is!
* Run WoW on Microsoft Windows
  * Simply Run WoW.exe
* If asked to update hardware changes I recommend choosing 'No'
* Under Addons choose 'Enable out of date addons'
* Create your character
* After first login, exit client and restart; this is a required step to update your stats after getting instant 60!
* Change your video settings to match your screen resolution and windowed mode if preferred. You should be able to max all settings with most PCs. Make sure to choose 24 bit color with max multisamlpe or edges will appear very jagged.
* Black Screen Fix (dual monitor bug) (Thanks Taic!): open Config file in WTF folder and add a line SET gxWindow "1"
* Profit!

Tips:
* Ony bags can be purchased from the 'Miscellaneous' Goblin
* Filter out unavailable skills at your trainer so you can spam-click learn
