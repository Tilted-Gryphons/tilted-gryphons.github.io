Our completed policy for alt raiding in TBC will be determined soon.

### Friends and Family
• Friends and Family can raid with us under the caveat below. <br />
• Caveat: if we have a completely blank spot in a raid that can't be filled by someone on the bench and would otherwise be empty for the whole raid, then we will look for online friends and family to fill that spot.

### Loot Hierarchy
• Loot is *always* distributed at the discretion of the Loot Council, but alts fall under a lower priority than main characters. Raider alts still perform a vital role, especially when called upon to fill a spot needed to complete an encounter, and have a higher priority than Friends and Family. <br />
