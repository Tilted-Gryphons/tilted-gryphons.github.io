Deitz and Rothana handle everything to do with alts.

### BWL
• A maximum of five alts will be allowed into BWL. <br />
• Your alt should be logged out at the instance ready to raid - be proactive don't make us summon it. <br />
• You must submit your alt application in the #alt-applications channel by Monday. The weekly officer meeting is now happening on Monday evenings, and we will be discussing which alts will attend that week's BWL at that time. If you ask on raid day, the answer will be no. <br />
• There are no alts allowed on DMF week. <br />
• You can't bring your alt two weeks in a row. <br />
• You must have 100% attendance over the last 12 raids.

### AQ40
• Alts may come under some special circumstances. If your alt is already Honoured with Brood of Nozdormu you can apply to bring your alt for an AQ40 raid to pick up the tokens. <br />
• We are not disallowing alts from getting idols and scarabs, they can have them if they are in the bank and aren't needed by mains. The bank however will not purchase idols/scarabs for alts if we are out. First come first serve.

### Friends and Family
• Friends and Family need to apply for raids in the alt channel. <br />
• Caveat: if we have a completely blank spot in a raid that can't be filled by someone on the bench and would otherwise be empty for the whole raid, then we will look for online friends and family to fill that spot.

### Loot Hierarchy
• The loot hierarchy rules are as follows. Please do not abuse this system by scooping up every OS item you can get your hands on just because you can.  <br />
• Loot is *always* distributed at the discretion of the Loot Council. <br />

**1.** Main Raider MS > OS <br />
**2.** Raider Alts MS > OS <br />
**3.** Friends and Family MS > OS
