**_Tilted Gryphons_** is a [semicore](/pages/semicore) PvE Alliance guild playing on the North American server Pagle. <br />

### Officer Roles
In general, everyone's on pretty level playing field. Officers are players who have volunteered to put in some extra effort to help keep the guild running so that everyone can have fun and clear content, as well as continually improve our standards over time. You may see us all pile into the Round Table channel in Discord for the weekly meeting. Please note that officers don't get any extra perks for their efforts, they're players too!

### Which Officer Should I Contact?
Officers are around to talk to! You are welcome to reach out to any officer that you feel most appropriate or comfortable with about other issues you may have. Keep us informed, be respectful, and together lets maintain a supportive and positive guild culture! Of course if you only feel okay about speaking up if you can be anonymous, there is the [suggestion box](https://forms.gle/DWDiP5uZ4MqrgdZe7)!
