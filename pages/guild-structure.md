title: Tilted Gryphons Structure and Officers
classes: wide
---
**_Tilted Gryphons_** is a [semicore](/pages/semicore) PvE Alliance guild playing on the North American server Pagle. <br />

### Officer Roles
We have one Guild Master and eight Class Leaders (CLs) who form our officer core. Officers are players who have volunteered to put in some extra effort to help keep the guild running so that everyone can have fun and clear content. You may see us all pile into the Round Table channel in Discord for the weekly meeting on Wednesdays.

Our CLs have a great deal of autonomy. Guild-wide rules are determined and discussed by all of the officers, but class leaders are ultimately in charge of everyone within their class – be it setting up rotations, what mods are required, how many raiders of that class we should have, specs, or loot distribution.

### Which Officer Should I Contact?
Officers are around to talk to! Whilst you need to speak to your CL about anything class related, you are welcome to reach out to any officer that you feel most appropriate or comfortable with about other issues you may have. Keep us informed, be respectful, and together lets maintain a supportive and positive guild culture! Of course if you only feel okay about speaking up if you can be anonymous, there is the [suggestion box](https://forms.gle/DWDiP5uZ4MqrgdZe7)!
