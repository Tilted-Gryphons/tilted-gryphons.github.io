Although we do not have a great many casual players, anyone is welcome to join the guild. Our requirements are simple: <br />
• You need to be over 18. <br />
• Don't be crass, vile, or toxic. <br />
We want to create and maintain a friendly guild that everyone is proud to be a part of. Be conscious that you have our guild name above your head when you're out in the world. We want members who are as courteous to a random stranger as they are to their guildmates.

### Tilted Gryphons
Tilted Gryphons is a PvE-focused semi-core raiding guild which looks for social and progression-oriented players in order to complete content in a timely manner and have a rowdy good time doing it! We don't mind if you're new to the game, or played since 2005, we have room for everyone if they're willing to be a positive member of our community.

**Goals:** <br />
• Be a visible name in the progression community. <br />
• Be a welcoming and friendly environment that you ***want*** to play with every night. <br />
• Clear all content as efficiently as we reasonably can. <br />
• Uphold a reputation with the people we play with to keep Tilted Gryphons a name that's synonymous with a positive community.

**Member Conduct:** <br />
• Emulate the Gryphon. Be friendly to others, don't be a dick, contribute to the guild and server community in a way that would make everyone proud to be a part of it, and have a drive to take action when called upon. <br />
• For our raiders, the willingness to improve - demonstrate an ability to better yourself and the raid! Sometimes this might require respecs and other times a role just might not fit our team. We try our best here. <br />
• Be able to use Discord with push to talk if you're interested in being an endgame player.

### Recruitment Process
You will have posted in the #new-recruits Discord channel. We will see this post and the CL for your class will respond to you. If we want to recruit you, then you will need to complete an interview with the Class Lead and at least one other officer via voice chat. To avoid crowding and intimidation we prefer to keep this to a maximum of three officers.

We _will_ reach out to your previous guild and ask them about you. However we aren't scary, we're just trying to protect our guild and recruit people who share our attitude towards raiding and who seem like decent, kind people.

After an interview and some vetting, the officers, including your CL, will decide whether or not to accept you as a new recruit. As a War Fledgeling you'll need to make a good impression on us. We are looking for skill at playing your class, your ability to listen, to work well with your CL, your general attitude, and how well you mesh with our guild culture. The trial period lasts a minimum of three weeks.

### How to Join
Good job if you've read this far! Please go to our [Discord](https://tiltedgryphons.com) and follow these directions: <br />
1. In the *#read-me-first* channel type: ?accept <br />
2. Then in the *#new-recruits* channel please post your in-game name, current level, class, and desired end-game spec. <br />
3. Wait for an officer to get in touch with you. This may take a day. <br />
Once you're in the guild in-game, you will then receive your rank in Discord and unlock all of the remaining channels! If you have any questions please feel free to DM an officer.
