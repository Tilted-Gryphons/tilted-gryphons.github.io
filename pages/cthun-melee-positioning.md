Make sure you are directly in front of the little "closed eye" in your sector during P1!

If you are close enough to the Eye, you will not get knocked back when the small mindflay tentacles spawn. When the tentacles do spwan they will be right behind your small closed eye position. Your entire group is responsible for killing the mindflay tentacle at your position!

In P2, the small eyes line up directly with the mouths between C'Thun's body tentacles. This marker is used to help your group find their position.

During P2 you will stand in the same position but out away from C'Thun (until vulnerability phase). This position will help you know which small mindflay tentalce your group should be killing. Assign 2 DPS from your group to kill the mindflay tentacles in P2 while the other 2 DPS move toward large Eyes or Claws.
