DM an officer on Discord to get yourself added to the list!
- Don't expect me to notice loot, comments, or even tells in-game... send a direct message on Discord.
- Enchanting and Alchemy are at the top because I think they're what people most frequently need to find a lackey for.
- If there's an important item missing let me know.

## This page will be populated once crafters reach 70 and attain recipes, check back later.
