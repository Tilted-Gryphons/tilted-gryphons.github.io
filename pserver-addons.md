# pserver Addons and Macros

**Classic Macros and Addons WILL NOT WORK on the old client!!!**

## Macros

[Huge list of Vanilla Macros](https://github.com/Meridaw/Vanilla-Macros)

#### Useful Macros
Start Attack, does not show CDs or tooltip so I recommend using it on one ability you always use first, like Sunder Armor
```
/script if (not PlayerFrame.inCombat) then AttackTarget() end
/cast Maul
```
Max Zoom Camera, have to run each time you log in
```
/console CameraDistanceMaxFactor 5
```

## Addons

*Delete your addons folder if you have an older pack! This has improved versions of some addons!*
